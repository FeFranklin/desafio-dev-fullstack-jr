<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

This project is my solution for the Fullstack developed challenge of RECRUT.AI. The requirements were flexible and I was able to choose the most comftable way to do it.
The backend is an Express.JS API connected to the supabase backend. The frontend is a NEXT.JS React application using react-bootstrap and MaterialUI.
The app itself is simple. Three possible pages: The Landing page directing the user for the possible operations; The registering page to add new clients to the DB (create);
the List page which show the clients saved in the db and allows update and delete (read, update, delete).
